# [SPRINT: For Your Fastest Commute](https://sprint-io.herokuapp.com/) (Front-end Repository)


SPRINT is a personal navigation tool for the everyday commute. Enter your destination address and the app calculates whether driving or taking public transit would get you there faster. 

I decided to build this app because it solves an issue that many people face during their daily commute. When determining how long a trip will take via public transportation, Google Maps does not take real-time bus vehicle arrivals into account, resulting in a skewed idea of total trip duration. SPRINT solves this problem by including bus stop arrivals and showing you your transit vehicles actual location. Now you can plan better and stop worrying about whether the bus will be on time or not. 

Please check out [SPRINT Server Github Repository](https://github.com/NrupM/sprint) for the back-end code.

This page features a search bar for you to enter your destination, two icons that change colors to indicate whether taking public transit or driving would get you there faster plus real time map markers showing you where exactly your next bus is located. 

### Mobile-Friendly

The app was designed for mobile accessability

### User Authentication View

Original wireframes were built with the idea of having user authentication set up. I am still contemplating whether this would be a valuable feature to impliment. Maybe there is another way to save user specific bookmarks without having someone login each time they visit the app??
